    Jackson.\"\n\n\"Thank you. This interview is to investigate the cause of the repeated
    calls to the fire department. To begin, can you describe the process of fogging
    a room?\"\n\t\t\"So we start by getting out the fogger machine, the fogger fluid,
    and the covers smoke detectors. We then take that to whatever room we're assigned
    to Once we get there, we put the covers on the smoke detector and add fluid to
    the machine. We turn on the machine and then we put it all away once it's done.\"\n\n\"Who
    put the cover on last time?\"\n\t\t\"Kevin, I think.\"\n\n\"And did Kevin put
    it on correctly?.\"\n\t\t\"I didn't watch him do it so I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"Alright,
    well those are all the questions I have. Thank you for your time.\""
