  content: "THE FILE BEGINS:\n10/15/2018\n\n\"Please state your name for the record.\"\n\t\t\"Kevin
    Gale.\"\n\n\"Thank you. This interview is to investigate the cause of the repeated
    calls to the fire department. To begin, can you describe the process of fogging
    a room?\"\n\t\t\"First, we get all of the equipment from the back. Then we go
    to the room and we put the covers on the smoke detectors. Then we add fluid and
    run the machine. Once it's done, we put it back.\"\n\n\"Who put the cover on last
    time?\"\n\t\t\"I believe is was Don.\"\n\n\"Well Don said it was you.\"\n\t\t\"I
    don't remember doing it.\"\n\n\"So, if neither of you put on the cover, who did?\"\n\t\t\"I
    have no clue.\"\n\n\"Did you and Don pass your assessment?\"\n\t\t\"I did and
    as far as I know, Don did too.\"\n\n\"Alright, well those are all the questions
    I have. Thank you for your time.\""
